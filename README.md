# Air-Sense-Empowering-Air-Quality-Prediction-Using-ML-Models

Air quality has always been one of the most important environmental concerns for the general public and society. Obviously, poor air quality has severe effects on people’s health. If we can predict air quality, we can adjust our behaviour on different levels ranging from individual behaviour to communities, nations and even globally. 

Predicting air quality is a challenging problem since air quality can differ significantly from one place to another – from quiet residential areas and parks to busy streets and industrial areas. We also need to consider atmospheric patterns such as rain, air pressure, temperature, etc., which affect the volume of each pollutant in the air. Many existing models for air quality prediction are constrained by unbalanced data or time-consuming manual annotation bias.  

### *My research project on air quality prediction using machine learning algorithms has been published in IEEE Xplore - International Conference on Recent Trends in Advance Computing (ICRTAC 2023).*

#### **This research provides a novel approach for predicting air quality based on the Light GBM algorithm.**

*We wanted to improve AQI prediction by harnessing LGBM's capabilities. Our strategy included a rigorous feature selection procedure utilizing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The LGBM model performed admirably, reaching a fantastic R-Square value of (0.94) with lower error rates of RMSE (9.78), MSE (95.60), MAPE (8.20), and MAE (8.45), this high R2 demonstrates the model's great capacity to explain the variance in AQI values. As a result, it is a better choice for predicting air quality. This study made use of Python and prominent data science cloud platforms including Google Colab and Anaconda Navigator (Jupyter Notebook).*
